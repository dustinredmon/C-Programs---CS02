# List of Projects:
# 
# alphabetical_order       : A simple program to arrange a list of string texts in 
#                            alhabetical order.
# bulls_cows               : A guessing game where a user guesses a number, and the app 
#                            responds with a 
#                            number of bulls and cows. Bulls = the user guessed correct 
#                            number in the correct place. Cows =the user guessed a correct 
#                            number but not in the correct location.
# calculate_grade          : a simple grade calulator to evaluate your grade for the class.
# calculator               : a simple calculator that supports addition, subtraction, 
#                            multiplication, and division.
# coins                    : a simple change calculator to calculate nickels, dimes, 
#                            pennies and quarters.
# emperor_grains           : a program to solve a simple riddle. The emperor must pay 
#                            someone in grains based on the 64 spaces of chess board. 
#                            If you start with 1 grain on the first space, and the grains are 
#                            doubled for each space, how many grains are there?
# fibonacci_sequence       : a program to write out all the values of the Fibonacci sequence
# guessing_game            : A simple "guess the number" game. The program will ask questions 
#                            to guess the user's number. 
# MinMaxAvg                : A program that reads a list of integers and outputs a Minimum, 
#                            Maximum, and Average.
# N_integers_vectors       : A program that reads a list of integers, and provides the sum 
#                            of the numbers up to the nth position desired by the user.
# numerical_sequence       : Takes a list of numbers, and outputs them in numberical order.
# permutation_combinations : a program that asks for 2 numbers, and calculates permutations 
#                            and combinations.
# primeNumber              : a program to list prime numbers between 1-100.
# quadratic_equation       : A program to solve quadratic equations.
